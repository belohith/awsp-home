# Introduction <br/>
Name: Lohith Bollineni <br/>
Course: Advanced Web Server Programming <br/>
Semester: Spring 2023 <br/>

I'm a graduate student studying computer Science now but my undergrad major was Electronics and Communications. During my undergrad, I realized that I like the software part of the subject more than the hardware and hence I decided to study Computer Science in more depth for my Master's degree. I neither knew programming nor the beauty of it until my third year of undergrad. Once I did, I could imagine so many ideas that could actually become a reality due to programming. I started by learning Web development basics (like HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and then went on to learn Android Mobile App Development after studying some basic Java. There were hundreds of resources on the internet to make clones of projects. I tried them initially to learn how it's done. Once I figured out the basics, I was no longer interested in replicating someone's projects. I wanted to make my own projects and hence I started working on a game app called Bytes. It's a different version of the popular arcade game "Whack-a-mole". After that I worked on a few projects, which are available on my website (www.belohith.com)

I have worked on a few projects using web development but I believe that there is a lot more to learn. This course will help me to learn so many things realted to that. Hence I'm really looking forward to learn and implement everything I've learnt.
